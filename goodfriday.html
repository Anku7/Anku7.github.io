                </div>
                    <p><h3> Good Friday is a significant day that reminds us of the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ,the Son of God, for the sins of the World. <br> <br> It is the day of the Crucification of Lord JESUS CHRIST. <br>About 2000 years ago on this day JESUS CHRIST died on the Cross.</h3> 
                        <h1>Why it is called good ? </h1>
                    <p><h2> God’s Salvation Plan for Mankind</h2></p>
<h3> Before we proceed with identifying the significance of Good Friday, we first need to understand God’s salvation plan for us. This plan includes how Jesus willingly sacrificed his life, by enduring the most torturous death to pay for our sins so that we may find eternal salvation (John 3:16). Jesus’ death is an important significant part of why this day is called Good Friday. </h3>

   <h2>John 3:16</h2> 
    <br>
   <h3>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
</h3>    
 <br>
    <br>
   <h2>Romans 6:23</h2> 
    <br>
   <h3>For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
</h3>  <br>
    <br>
   <h3>Because of the sinful nature of the world, we all fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). Sin separates us from God and the punishment for sin is death. No amount of hard work or good deeds can earn us God’s favor for our salvation cannot be earned or bought. Paying for the sins of the world requires great sacrifice. God showed His unconditional love by giving us his one and only begotten son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for our salvation.
</h3>   <br>
    <br>
   <h3>Jesus lived a sinless life; an example of how should we live. When Jesus rose again in three days, he proved that he is the son of God. Jesus offers the gift of salvation and forgiveness of sins for those who repent and believe in him. Through him, we can receive our salvation and eternal life in heaven.
<br> <br> God is holy and humans are sinful; holiness is incompatible with sin, so humanity's sin separates us from God. The punishment for sin is eternal death. But human death and animal sacrifices are insufficient to atone for sin. Atonement requires a perfect, spotless sacrifice, offered in just the right way.
<br><br>
 Jesus Christ was the one and only perfect God-man, that his death provided the perfect atoning sacrifice for sin and that through Jesus, our own sins can be forgiven. Consequently, when we accept Jesus Christ's payment for sin, he washes away our sin and restores our right standing with God; God's mercy and grace make salvation possible and we receive the gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ. These beliefs explain why the date of Jesus' crucifixion is considered a "Good" Friday.
<br><br><H2>Last Words Of Lord JESUS CHRIST: It is Finished</H2><br><br>
<h3>Jesus, with “it is finished” is saying not only does He take away man’s sin, but now He removes it as far as the east is to the west, for is finished, done, signed, and sealed because of the blood of Jesus.
    <br><br>So JESUS offers you the forgivenes of sins and the privileged to be the son of the Most High God
</h3> <br><br><h1>How to be Saved ?</h1><br><br>
<h3>Here is God's simple way to be saved. You are a sinner, your heart is wrong, you cannot save yourself, you are already condemned. The thing you are to do then, to be saved, is to simply trust the Lord Jesus with that matter. When you do trust Him, then you have God's promise, "Thou shalt be saved."
<br>
    I do not mean that you are simply to believe that there is a God or that there is a Saviour. Devils believe that and tremble (James 2:19).
    <br>
    You can believe that a certain physician is a good doctor [without calling him to be your doctor] when you are sick. You can believe that a certain man is a good lawyer without taking him as your lawyer to defend your case. You are not just to believe the truth about Jesus; you are to believe on Him, that is, depend upon Him, risk Him, trust Him; and when you do, you are saved.</h3>

              <h1>Invite JESUS into Your Life By doing this Prayer</h1><br><br>
              <h3>Dear Lord,
                I admit that I am a sinner. I have done many things that don’t please you. I have lived my life for myself only. I am sorry, and I repent. I ask you to forgive me.
              <br>  I believe that you died on the cross for me, to save me. You did what I could not do for myself. I come to you now and ask you to take control of my life; I give it to you. From this day forward, help me to live every day for you and in a way that pleases you.
              <br>  I love you, Lord, and I thank you that I will spend all eternity with you.
              <br>  Amen.</h3> 
              <h3>We welcome you in this family in which our Head is Lord JESUS CHRIST , and we are the different organs of this family.
                  <br><br>God Bless You.</h3>     <br><br>
